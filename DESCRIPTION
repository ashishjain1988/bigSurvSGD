Description: Fits Cox Model via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This implementation avoids computational instability of the 
	standard Cox Model when dealing large datasets. Furthermore, it scales up with large datasets 
	that do not fit the memory. It also handles large sparse datasets using Proximal stochastic 
	gradient descent algorithm.
